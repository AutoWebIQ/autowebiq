### Option 2: Use Demo Account (Backend Testing)

**API Testing with Demo Account:**

# Get demo user info (replace with actual JWT token after login)
curl -X GET "https://autowebiq.preview.emergentagent.com/api/v2/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check validation system
curl -X GET "https://autowebiq.preview.emergentagent.com/api/v2/validate/checks"

# Check health
curl -X GET "https://autowebiq.preview.emergentagent.com/api/health"
```
