# AutoWebIQ Dynamic Credit System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Emergent-style dynamic credit system with real-time deduction, automatic refunds, and comprehensive transaction ledger.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Credit Calculation
- **Per-Agent Costs**: Different costs for each agent type (Planner, Frontend, Backend, Image, Testing)
- **Per-Model Costs**: Based on AI model used (GPT-5, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini, DALL-E 3)
- **Complexity Multipliers**: Simple chat (1x), code generation (1.5x), multi-agent (2x)
- **Multi-Agent Discount**: 10% discount when using 4+ agents (bulk operation efficiency)

### 2. Credit Cost Table

**Agent-Based Costs:**
```
Planner Agent (Claude Sonnet 4):  5 credits
Frontend Agent (GPT-4o):          8 credits
Backend Agent (GPT-4o):           6 credits
Image Agent (DALL-E 3):          12 credits per image
Testing Agent (GPT-4o):           4 credits
Deployment Agent:                 3 credits
```

**Model-Based Costs:**
```
GPT-5:                            8 credits
GPT-4o:                           5 credits
Claude Sonnet 4:                  6 credits
Gemini 2.5 Pro:                   4 credits
DALL-E 3:                        12 credits
```

**Multi-Agent Build Costs (Dynamic):**
- **Simple build** (Frontend + Planner + Testing): ~17 credits
- **With images** (+ Image Agent): ~29 credits
- **Full-stack** (+ Backend): ~35 credits
- **With discount** (4+ agents): 10% off total

### 3. Transaction System

**Transaction Types:**
- `deduction` - Credits deducted for operations
- `refund` - Partial or full credit refund
- `purchase` - Credit purchase (Razorpay integration)
- `signup_bonus` - 20 credits on registration
- `monthly_reset` - Monthly credit allocation

**Transaction Status:**
- `pending` - Operation in progress
- `completed` - Successful completion
- `refunded` - Full/partial refund issued
- `failed` - Operation failed

### 4. Credit Deduction Flow

**Reserve → Execute → Complete/Refund**

```python
# Step 1: Calculate estimated cost
estimated_cost = calculate_multi_agent_cost(agents, models)

# Step 2: Reserve credits upfront
transaction = reserve_credits(user_id, estimated_cost)

# Step 3: Execute operation
try:
    result = build_website(...)
    
    # Step 4a: Success - Complete transaction
    actual_cost = calculate_actual_cost(result)
    complete_transaction(transaction_id, actual_cost)
    # Automatically refunds difference if actual < estimated
    
except Exception:
    # Step 4b: Failure - Full refund
    refund_credits(user_id, estimated_cost, "Operation failed")
```

### 5. API Endpoints

**Credit Management:**
- `GET /api/credits/balance` - Get current balance
- `GET /api/credits/transactions` - Transaction history (last 50)
- `GET /api/credits/summary` - Usage summary (spent, refunded, purchased)
- `GET /api/credits/pricing` - Get agent & model costs

**Multi-Agent Build:**
- `POST /api/build-with-agents` - Dynamic credit deduction based on agents used

### 6. Real-Time Credit Updates

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "credits_used": 28,
  "credits_refunded": 7,
  "remaining_balance": 45,
  "cost_breakdown": {
    "planner": 5,
    "frontend": 8,
    "backend": 6,
    "image": 12,
    "testing": 4,
    "total": 35,
    "discount": 7
  }
}
```

### 7. Database Schema

**Credit Transactions Collection:**
```javascript
{
  id: "txn_20250130_abc123",
  user_id: "user_id",
  type: "deduction|refund|purchase|signup_bonus",
  amount: -20,  // Negative for deduction, positive for refund
  operation: "multi_agent_build",
  status: "completed|pending|refunded|failed",
  metadata: {
    project_id: "proj_id",
    agents_used: ["planner", "frontend", "image"],
    breakdown: {...}
  },
  created_at: "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z",
  updated_at: "2025-01-30T10:05:00Z"
}
```

### 8. Signup Credits

**New Users Receive:**
- **20 credits** (Emergent standard, not 10)
- Transaction logged as `signup_bonus`
- Recorded in credit ledger

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - 20 credits
- `POST /api/auth/firebase/sync` - 20 credits for new users
- `POST /api/auth/google/session` - 20 credits for new users

### 9. Backward Compatibility

✅ **Existing users keep their current balance** - No data loss
✅ **Chat endpoint** still uses MODEL_COSTS for simple operations
✅ **Project credit tracking** - Each project stores `credit_cost` field

### 10. Refund Mechanisms

**Automatic Refunds:**
1. **Partial Completion**: If estimated 35 credits but only used 28, refund 7 credits
2. **Operation Failure**: Full refund if build fails
3. **Exception Handling**: Full refund on any exception

**Manual Refunds:**
- Admin can issue refunds via API (future enhancement)
- Razorpay payment failures trigger automatic refund

## 📊 Credit Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Multi-Agent Build
```
User wants: "Build a landing page for tech startup"
Agents used: Planner (5) + Frontend (8) + Image (12) + Testing (4)
Total: 29 credits
User has: 50 credits
Final balance: 21 credits
```

### Example 2: Full-Stack with Discount
```
User wants: "Build a SaaS dashboard with backend API"
Agents used: Planner (5) + Frontend (8) + Backend (6) + Image (12) + Testing (4)
Subtotal: 35 credits
Discount (4+ agents): -3.5 credits (10%)
Total: 31.5 ≈ 32 credits
User has: 50 credits
Final balance: 18 credits
```

### Example 3: Build Failure with Refund
```
User wants: Complex app
Estimated: 35 credits
Reserved: 35 credits
Build fails at Frontend stage
Refunded: 35 credits
Final balance: Unchanged
```

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Features

### Razorpay Credit Purchase
- Still works with existing packages
- Transactions logged in credit_transactions
- Type: `purchase`

### Firebase/Google OAuth
- New users get 20 credits automatically
- Signup bonus transaction created
- Legacy users unaffected

### Project Management
- Projects now store `credit_cost` field
- Shows cost breakdown per project
- Transaction history linked to projects

## 🚀 Frontend Integration Required

### Display Real-Time Credit Usage
```javascript
// During build, show live updates
const buildResult = await axios.post('/api/build-with-agents', {...});
console.log(`Credits used: ${buildResult.credits_used}`);
console.log(`Remaining: ${buildResult.remaining_balance}`);
console.log('Breakdown:', buildResult.cost_breakdown);
```

### Show Transaction History
```javascript
const transactions = await axios.get('/api/credits/transactions');
// Display in Credits page with:
// - Date/time
// - Operation type
// - Credits used/refunded
// - Balance after transaction
```

### Display Pricing Table
```javascript
const pricing = await axios.get('/api/credits/pricing');
// Show agent costs and model costs
// Help users understand cost structure
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [x] New user registration → 20 credits
- [x] Firebase sync new user → 20 credits  
- [x] Google OAuth new user → 20 credits
- [ ] Multi-agent build → Dynamic cost calculation
- [ ] Build failure → Full refund
- [ ] Partial completion → Partial refund
- [ ] Transaction history → Correctly logged
- [ ] Credit balance → Real-time updates
- [ ] Insufficient credits → Proper error message

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

All credit operations logged with:
```python
logger.info(f"Reserved {amount} credits for user {user_id}")
logger.info(f"Completed transaction {txn_id} (refund: {refund})")
logger.info(f"Refunded {amount} credits to user {user_id}")
```

Check logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log | grep -i "credit"
```

## 🎓 Key Differences from Fixed Cost

**Before (Fixed):**
- Multi-agent build: Always 20 credits
- No breakdown
- No refunds on partial completion
- Simple deduction

**After (Dynamic - Emergent Style):**
- Multi-agent build: 17-35+ credits (based on agents used)
- Detailed breakdown per agent
- Automatic refunds on failure
- Progressive deduction with ledger tracking
- Real-time balance updates
- Transaction history
- Complexity-based pricing

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Double-Spend Prevention**: Transaction IDs ensure no duplicate deductions
2. **Balance Validation**: Check balance before reservation
3. **Atomic Operations**: Database updates are atomic
4. **Audit Trail**: All transactions logged permanently
5. **Max Credits Per Task**: 1000 credits (Emergent's constraint)

## 🌟 Benefits

1. **Fair Pricing**: Users only pay for what they use
2. **Transparency**: Clear breakdown of costs
3. **Automatic Refunds**: No manual intervention needed
4. **Scalable**: Supports future agent types and models
5. **Emergent-Compatible**: Same logic as Emergent platform
