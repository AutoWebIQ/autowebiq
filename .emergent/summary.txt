<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles the development of an AI web application, evolving from a basic AI assistant to a complex platform clone named AutoWebIQ. Initially, the user requested an AI with core capabilities like chat, code generation, file analysis, and image generation, powered by OpenAI GPT-5, with features like chat history and user authentication. This led to an initial build and basic bug fixes.

A significant pivot occurred when the user demanded an *exact clone* of the Emergent platform, encompassing a per-message credit system, multiple AI models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4), real-time website generation with live preview, and advanced UI/UX (split-screen workspace, code editor, voice commands, file uploads). The project iterated through several phases: initial build, integration of Razorpay payments, implementation of the credit system, and comprehensive UI/UX overhauls, including addressing issues like WebSocket limitations, AI model budget/quota problems, and responsive design. The engineer diligently addressed user feedback, including branding changes to AutoWebIQ, scrollability, loading indicators, and improving authentication flow. The last interaction shows the engineer actively rebuilding the authentication system to be more robust and user-friendly, indicating an ongoing task.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial request was to build an AI assistant with capabilities mirroring the AI engineer itself: text chat, code generation/explanation, file/document analysis, and image generation. The primary AI model was specified as OpenAI GPT-5, with modularity for future integration of Claude or Gemini. Essential features included chat history, multiple conversation threads, file upload/analysis, and code syntax highlighting. User authentication via JWT username/password was also a core requirement, with a future option for Google login.

This evolved into a comprehensive platform clone, initially named Optra AI, and later AutoWebIQ. The expanded requirements include:
- An exact clone of the Emergent platform's functionality and UI.
- User registration, login, and robust authentication with a forgot password option.
- A credit-based system where users buy credits to utilize AI features, with free starting credits (50).
- Payment processing via Razorpay, supporting UPI, credit, and debit cards, with commission integration.
- Multiple AI model selection: Claude 4.5 Sonnet (200k/1M context), GPT-5 (Beta), and Claude 4.0 Sonnet.
- AI-powered website generation from prompts with real-time progress indicators (thinking, loading, working logos).
- A split-screen workspace featuring chat/AI on the left and a live, auto-updating preview of the generated website on the right, with an Open in New Tab option.
- Advanced chat functionalities: voice commands, file/photo/video uploads (integrated with Cloudinary), and options to save/fork to GitHub.
- Manual edit mode for generated websites with a code editor (Monaco editor).
- Enhanced UI/UX: aesthetically pleasing design, correct color schemes, proper spacing, custom scrollbars on all pages, micro-animations, fast and intuitive interface, and clear visibility of critical elements like username on the header.
- Branding: AutoWebIQ as the application name, with all Made with Emergent branding removed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a significant overhaul of the **authentication system** for AutoWebIQ. The user reported issues with login/signup (not creative, fast, or easy enough) and requested forgot password functionality, already registered messages, and more robust UI.

The engineer's current actions were focused on:
1.  **Adding Forgot Password Backend**: Modifying  to support the forgot password flow (Chat Message 467-470).
2.  **Rebuilding Auth Page with Better UI**: Updating  to enhance the visual design and user experience of the login/signup page. This included adding the  import for visual feedback (Chat Message 471-474).
3.  **Updating CSS for New Auth Page**: Modifying  to apply the necessary styles for the redesigned authentication interface (Chat Message 475-476).

The last action recorded was the AI engineer preparing to restart services (, , , ) after these authentication-related changes (Chat Message 477). This indicates that the new authentication UI and its backend support are currently being integrated and made ready for testing, and the system is in the process of applying these updates.
