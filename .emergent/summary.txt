The trajectory chronicles the transformation of AutoWebIQ from a template-based website generator into a full-stack development platform, aiming to rival Emergent. The AI engineer systematically addressed user requests, starting with bug fixes (login, image upload, project creation) and then implementing a multi-agent workflow, a token-based credit system, and multi-page website generation. A significant architectural shift involved creating a model router to intelligently orchestrate various LLMs (Claude for frontend, GPT for backend, Gemini for content, OpenAI gpt-image-1 for HD image generation). Backend modules for full-stack agents, workspace management, file system, iterative chat, terminal, and Git integration were developed. Subsequently, crucial frontend UI components like Code Editor, File Explorer, Terminal, and Git Panel were added. The current work culminated in setting up Kubernetes deployment manifests and scripts for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to achieve production readiness and scalability.

AutoWebIQ is envisioned as a multi-agent AI platform for AI-powered website generation with a live split-screen preview, Firebase Authentication, a dynamic credit system, LLM integrations (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini), image uploads, GitHub forking, and APIs for user/project/credit management. The primary goal is to achieve website generation quality, speed, and consistency comparable to Emergent, using a template/component-based system. The infrastructure was upgraded to PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and WebSockets, with 24 templates and 50 components available. Core user flows (login, image upload, API interactions) are largely stabilized. The user explicitly requested AutoWebIQ's credit system and agent workflow to be exactly like Emergent, generating functional multi-page websites with working navigation, forms, and relevant images. Ultimately, the user requested to make AutoWebIQ a full-stack developer platform, matching or exceeding Emergent's capabilities, including live development workspaces, inline code editing, iterative refinement, Git integration, and robust deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in setting up the complete Kubernetes infrastructure for AutoWebIQ's deployment to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This involved creating a comprehensive set of files:
- **Dockerfiles**:  and  were created to containerize the application components.
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: , , , , , , , , and  were generated. These YAML files define the necessary Kubernetes resources for deployment, including deployments for the backend, frontend, MongoDB, Redis, ingress rules for routing, and horizontal pod auto-scaling.
- **Deployment Scripts**: , , , and  were created to automate the GKE deployment process, update existing deployments, facilitate rollbacks, and provide deployment instructions.

This work was a direct response to the user's explicit request to deploy everything to my domain autowebiq.com and subsequently choosing the best deployment option, which the AI interpreted as GKE for maximum scalability and production readiness. The AI engineer's immediate next step was to make these newly created deployment scripts executable, signifying the culmination of the infrastructure setup phase.
