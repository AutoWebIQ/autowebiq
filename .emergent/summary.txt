The AI engineer's work involved transforming AutoWebIQ from an MVP AI assistant into a full-scale multi-agent AI website generation platform akin to Emergent. Initial tasks focused on fixing login, Google OAuth, and upgrading LLMs. A major pivot occurred to implement a self-hosted platform with multi-AI agents, live previews, full-stack generation, inline editing, and a robust credit system. The engineer meticulously set up Kubernetes/Docker infrastructure, integrated image uploads, and added GitHub fork functionality. Significant effort was dedicated to debugging Firebase authentication, resolving React build issues related to dynamic imports, and persistently addressing MongoDB SSL connection problems in the development environment. The credit system was also fully overhauled to mirror Emergent's dynamic logic. The work culminated in fixing core platform functionalities, including project creation and a detailed credit system.

The initial goal for AutoWebIQ was an AI assistant offering text chat, code generation, and image generation with OpenAI GPT-5, including chat history and JWT authentication. This evolved into replicating the Emergent platform, requiring robust Firebase Auth (Email/Password, Google, GitHub), a dynamic credit system with Razorpay (20 initial credits for new users, auto-deduction, refund on failure, real-time display matching Emergent's logic), multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini), and AI-powered website generation with real-time split-screen preview. Additional features included voice commands, file uploads via Cloudinary, Monaco code editor, and a polished UI/UX. The ultimate vision encompassed a multi-AI agent builder (frontend, backend, DB, testing, deployment), live progress logs, full-stack generation, inline editing, project saving/exporting, one-click custom domain deployment (Cloudflare), rebuild capabilities, and an admin dashboard. Recent requirements focused on a unified UI (single chat, live preview, project list), shareable/persistent preview URLs, image uploads in chat, GitHub forking, and specific backend API expectations for user, project, and credit management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving persistent MongoDB connection issues and ensuring the application's core functionalities, especially credit management and project creation, were robust. The trajectory detailed debugging a MongoDB SSL issue in the development environment, leading to a temporary switch to a local MongoDB instance to allow for testing. This involved modifying  and  to adapt the MongoDB client initialization with and without SSL parameters. A health check with the local MongoDB successfully reported a healthy database connection. Subsequently, the testing agent identified an issue with the  endpoint. The current work is precisely addressing this issue: the  method in  is incorrectly retrieving transactions because it's not excluding MongoDB's  from the response, causing serialization problems.
