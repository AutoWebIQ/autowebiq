<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on AutoWebIQ transitioned through several major phases. Initially, it focused on expanding the template and component library, successfully implementing 24 templates and 50 UI components, and loading them into MongoDB. The core work then shifted to a significant backend architectural upgrade, migrating from a MongoDB-only setup to an Emergent-style stack incorporating PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching and messaging, and Celery for asynchronous task processing. WebSockets were also integrated for real-time updates. This involved installing and configuring these services, creating new database models, migration scripts, and updating the FastAPI server to use the new infrastructure. Extensive debugging was performed on Celery task execution and WebSocket connectivity. The final phase involved frontend integration to utilize the new V2 API endpoints and WebSocket, making the upgraded workspace the default. The last major task involved collecting user input for further feature development, specifically regarding storage, deployment, CI/CD, and validation systems, and then fixing a non-critical Flower dashboard issue. The current state is preparing for GitHub repository setup.

<product_requirements>
AutoWebIQ aims to be a multi-agent AI platform mirroring Emergent's capabilities, featuring Firebase Auth, a dynamic credit system, multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini), and AI-powered website generation with live split-screen preview. The UI/UX requires a professional dashboard, dark/purple themes, and chat/preview layouts. Functional requirements include image uploads, GitHub forking, and backend APIs for user, project, and credit management. The main challenge is achieving website generation quality, speed, and consistency comparable to Emergent, which led to a template and component-based system. The user requested an ambitious template library (50+ templates, 200+ components) with AI customization, and infrastructure upgrades to match Emergent's backend (PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, WebSockets) and frontend (Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, SSR/SSG). So far, 24 templates and 50 components are loaded, and the backend has been refactored to use PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery with WebSockets.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on preparing the project for version control and further feature development after successfully completing a major backend refactor and bug fixes. All 7 core services (backend, Celery, Flower, Redis, PostgreSQL) are reported healthy. AWS S3 storage has been integrated and tested for file uploads, with credentials (, , , , ) added to the backend . The engineer also retrieved the Vercel API token from the user and planned its integration.

The user then asked for the tech stack for  and requested the GitHub repository creation. The engineer provided a detailed  template covering frontend (React/Node), backend (Python/FastAPI), databases, and sensitive files. The engineer then clarified that direct GitHub repository creation isn't possible but offered to prepare everything for the user to do it quickly, or to use a GitHub Personal Access Token for automation.

Currently, the engineer has added the Vercel token to the environment, removed the old , and created a new, comprehensive  file. The next step was to create a , but it failed as the file already existed. The immediate goal is to finalize the Git setup preparation, pending the user's decision on GitHub repository creation.
