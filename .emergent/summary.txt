The AI engineer's trajectory details the ambitious transformation of AutoWebIQ from a basic AI assistant into a full-scale, multi-agent AI website generation platform, mirroring the Emergent platform itself. Initially, the focus was on fixing login issues, integrating Google OAuth, and improving the core AI builder's reliability by upgrading to  and enhancing prompts. A significant pivot occurred when the user explicitly requested building a comprehensive, self-hosted platform with multi-AI agents, live previews, full-stack generation, inline editing, deployment capabilities, a credit system, and an admin dashboard. The engineer meticulously outlined the extensive infrastructure (GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Cloudflare) and services required, categorizing tasks and requesting all necessary credentials. The current work involves setting up the foundational multi-agent architecture in the backend and frontend, integrating various AI models, and crucially, building out the Kubernetes deployment manifests and Docker workspace templates, leveraging the newly provided cloud and Docker credentials to establish the production-grade infrastructure. The project is advancing towards a complete, self-hosted solution.

The user's initial goal was an AI assistant (Optra AI, later AutoWebIQ) offering text chat, code generation, file analysis, and image generation, primarily with OpenAI GPT-5, including chat history, multiple threads, and JWT authentication. This expanded to replicate the Emergent platform: robust Firebase Auth (Email/Password, Google, GitHub), a credit system with Razorpay, multiple LLM models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-5/4o, Gemini), AI-powered website generation with real-time preview (split-screen), voice commands, file uploads via Cloudinary, Monaco code editor for manual edits, and a polished UI/UX. The ultimate vision evolved into a full-scale AI website generation platform for AutoWebIQ, encompassing: a prompt-based builder spawning multi-AI agents (frontend, backend, DB, testing, deployment), live progress logs, real-time website preview, full-stack generation (code, images, backend API, DB schema), inline editing, project saving/exporting, one-click custom domain deployment (Cloudflare), rebuild capabilities, an enhanced credit system with Razorpay, and an admin dashboard for user/project management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively setting up the production-grade infrastructure for AutoWebIQ on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This follows the user's explicit request to build a full-scale AI website generation platform like Emergent.

The current work involves:
1.  **Securing Cloud Credentials**: The user provided extensive GCP, Docker Hub, Cloudflare, and GitHub credentials, including a GCP Service Account JSON key. The engineer updated  with these details and created  to store the service account key.
2.  **Creating Kubernetes Manifests**: The engineer is now generating the foundational Kubernetes YAML files in the newly created  directory. So far, , , and  have been created. These files are essential for defining the structure and configuration of the GKE cluster that will host AutoWebIQ's multi-tenant workspaces. This is a critical step towards enabling live preview subdomains and full-stack deployment capabilities as requested by the user.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue creating the remaining Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployments, services, ingress) based on the user's provided GCP and Cloudflare credentials.
