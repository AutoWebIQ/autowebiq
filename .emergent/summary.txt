The trajectory details the arduous journey of developing AutoWebIQ, initially focusing on bug fixes and enhancing an existing MVP towards a full-stack platform. The AI engineer sequentially addressed critical issues, from Kubernetes deployment and DNS configuration to backend database connectivity (MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL conflicts). A recurring theme was the user's strong desire for AutoWebIQ to not just match, but surpass Emergent, particularly in user experience, gradual credit deduction, and the quality/functionality of generated websites. After repeated deployment and functional issues, coupled with user frustration over misaligned expectations, a pivotal decision was made to entirely rebuild AutoWebIQ from scratch. The new build aims for a robust, simplified architecture with a focus on delivering a superior, fully-featured AI development platform, including a strong login, better landing page, modern interface, Emergent-style credit system, and comprehensive full-stack generation capabilities.

<product_requirements>
AutoWebIQ is envisioned as a multi-agent AI platform for website generation, aiming to rival and ultimately surpass Emergent. Key requirements include:
- Generating functional multi-page websites with working navigation, forms, and relevant images.
- Implementing a multi-agent workflow and a token-based credit system exactly like Emergent, where credits are deducted gradually per agent action, not in a single bulk transaction.
- Functionality for full-stack application generation, including backend logic, database interaction, user authentication, and API endpoints.
- Providing a live development workspace with features like inline code editing, iterative refinement, Git integration (Save to GitHub, Fork), and robust one-click deployment.
- Supporting various LLM integrations (Claude Sonnet 4 for frontend, GPT-4o for backend, Gemini 2.5 Pro for content, OpenAI gpt-image-1 for HD images).
- The application must have a strong, stable login system and an excellent user interface/user experience, generating production-ready websites with buttons, images, and incredible UI/UX.
- The overarching goal is for AutoWebIQ to be the best AI-powered website, software, and full-stack developer, surpassing Emergent in all comparable features and output quality.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend).
- **Databases:** MongoDB (primary), PostgreSQL (intended/migrated from), Redis (caching).
- **Deployment/Orchestration:** Kubernetes (GKE), Docker, Supervisor, Vercel/Netlify.
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, gpt-image-1), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4), Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro).
- **UI/DevTools:** Monaco Editor (for Code Editor), xterm.js (for Terminal), React Resizable Panels.
- **Authentication:** JWT (rebuild focus), Firebase (previous).

<code_architecture>
The application started with an existing React frontend and FastAPI backend, undergoing significant expansion and, recently, a complete rebuild.



-   ****: Main FastAPI entry point. Previously handled auth, Vercel deploy, full-stack build, workspace, file system, chat, terminal, git, deployment. Modified to work with MongoDB and remove PostgreSQL/Redis dependencies. New endpoints for  and  added.
-   ****: Coordinates AI agents. Updated to use  and Cloudinary. Modified to use MongoDB for template selection.
-   ** (NEW)**: Selects optimal LLMs for tasks.
-   ** (NEW)**: Introduced during the rebuild phase to handle generating multiple HTML files.
-   ** (NEW)**: Created as part of the rebuild to generate full-stack backend code.
-   **, , , ,  (NEW - Rebuild)**: Core files for the new, simplified, and robust backend architecture, focusing on JWT authentication, gradual credit deduction, and modular AI agents.
-   ****: Manages frontend dependencies, including , , , .
-   ****: Main workspace UI. Updated WebSocket handler, Vercel deployment. (Implicitly integrated new components, but this file itself was rebuilt in a  version).
-   **, , , , , , ,  (NEW - Rebuild)**: New frontend components for the complete rebuild, including a professional landing page, dashboard, and a workspace with Emergent-style agent display and advanced features.
-   **, Dockerfiles, , etc. (NEW)**: Kubernetes deployment manifests and scripts for GKE deployment, containerizing the application.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the new rebuild of AutoWebIQ 2.0, specifically:
    - Build out database models and authentication infrastructure for the new backend.
    - Implement gradual credit deduction based on agent activity, not bulk deduction.
    - Integrate agent status display prominently in the frontend.
    - Develop full-stack backend generation capabilities (API endpoints, CRUD operations).
    - Implement development tools like Code Editor, File Explorer, Terminal.
    - Integrate Git functionality (Save to GitHub).
    - Implement one-click deployment functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a complete rebuild of AutoWebIQ from scratch (referred to as AutoWebIQ 2.0). This drastic step was taken due to persistent deployment issues and a strong user demand to surpass Emergent's functionality and reliability, especially after repeated failures with the previous architecture.

The rebuild aims for a robust, simplified, and fully-featured AI development platform. The AI engineer has initiated the backend development for this new version by creating:
- : Likely for application-wide configuration.
- : To handle rock-solid JWT authentication, replacing previous Firebase/MongoDB auth complexities.
- : To implement the Emergent-style gradual credit deduction system.
- : The new main FastAPI server for the rebuilt application.
- : New definitions for AI agents, likely to support the gradual credit deduction and enhanced generation.
- : A new module specifically designed to generate full-stack backend code.

On the frontend, new  versions of core files have been created to support a clean, modern interface, a professional landing page, and a dashboard, including , , , , , and . The  was also recently added to handle multi-page website output. The current work is focused on actively building out these core components to achieve the goal of AutoWebIQ surpassing Emergent.

<optional_next_step>
Continue building out the new backend with database models, authentication, and the remaining infrastructure as part of the AutoWebIQ 2.0 rebuild.
